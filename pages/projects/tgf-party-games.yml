    ## About
    TGF Party Games a collection of custom, simple, and fun web based games designed for video/zoom calls.

    ### Developer Notes
    I built TGF Party Games because I was unable to find any 
    high quality, simple, and fun web based games that could easily be 
    played with larger groups of people on zoom calls during COVID-19.

    Every game is very small and simple, generally around 100 lines of TypeScript and HTML
    and can quickly be played with many people.

    TGF Stands for 'Thank God For' as the site was orignally built for Church youth group video events.
