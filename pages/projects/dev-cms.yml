    ## About
    dev-cms is a light-weight, modular Content Management System focused on ease of use for developers written in 
    [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & [Deno](https://deno.land/) using 
    [Oak](https://github.com/oakserver/oak) for the HTTP server, and
    [Denjucks](https://github.com/denjucks/denjucks) for templating.

    ### Developer Notes
    I built dev-cms to give me a customized way to easily create and manage this website and other simple or even complex websites.
    
    By default pages can written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or 
    [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) are and stored in yaml files, 
    but they can easily use any HTML renderer that supports Deno,
    and easily change how & where pages are stored with a simple plugin. 
    
    And themes can be used to change the look of the site, and can also implement 
    their own templating engine, so they are not limited to just using Nunjucks.
